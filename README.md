# Etch-A-Sketch
Browser version of Etch-A-Sketch as part of The Odin Project's curriculum.

### Overview

This is an interactive adaption of the old Etch-A-Sketch device for the browser. It supports three different color options,
two different erase options and one option to change the size of the matrix. 

### Learning outcome

This project gave me a deeper understanding of DOM manipulation and the interplay between HTML, CSS and Javascript. I now have
a better idea of changing CSS style rules interactively. 

### Where can I find it?
Just start drawing [here](https://pparmin.github.io/Etch-A-Sketch/)!
